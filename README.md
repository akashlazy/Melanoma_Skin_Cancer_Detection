# Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection
> Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
To identify Melanoma, Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.

- What is the background of your project?
To identify melanoma on that basis will predict cancer diagnosis.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

The data set contains the following diseases:

Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis
To overcome the overfitting in training process using data augmentation and adding dropout to our model.

- Conclusion 2 from the analysis
Validation accuracy:- around 65 to 70%
After using Augmentor, model get rid of overfitting.
Class rebalance is helpful.

- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
After increasing epochs 30 or 50 from 20 validation accuracy is drops.
